# Security Policy

## Overview

GoNFTme is a Web3 crowdfunding platform built with security as a top priority. This document outlines our security practices, testing procedures, and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security
- âœ… **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks on donation functions
- âœ… **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- âœ… **Access Controls**: Owner-only functions properly protected
- âœ… **Overflow Protection**: Using Solidity 0.8.20+ built-in overflow checks
- âœ… **Automatic Refunds**: Excess donations are automatically refunded
- âœ… **OpenZeppelin Standards**: Using battle-tested OpenZeppelin contracts

### Frontend Security
- âœ… **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs properly sanitized
- âœ… **CSRF Protection**: Next.js built-in CSRF protection
- âœ… **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers
- âœ… **Secure External Links**: All external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- âœ… **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- âœ… **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling without information leakage

### Infrastructure Security
- âœ… **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted
- âœ… **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables
- âœ… **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- âœ… **Code Analysis**: SonarQube security analysis
- âœ… **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive security test suite

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

Run comprehensive security analysis:
```bash
make security-full
```

Individual security checks:
```bash
make security-audit    # Dependency vulnerability scan
make security-lint     # Security-focused linting
make sonar-local      # SonarQube analysis
```

### Smart Contract Testing

All smart contracts have comprehensive test coverage:
```bash
make test-contracts
```

Tests include:
- Access control validation
- Input sanitization
- Reentrancy attack prevention
- Edge case handling
- Gas optimization validation

### Frontend Security Testing

Security-focused component tests:
```bash
make test
```

Tests cover:
- XSS attack prevention
- Input sanitization
- Error handling
- State management security
- External link validation

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
5. **Testing**: Write security tests for all new features

### For Users

1. **Wallet Security**: Use hardware wallets for large amounts
2. **Verify Addresses**: Always double-check recipient addresses
3. **Phishing Protection**: Only use the official domain
4. **Private Keys**: Never share your private keys
5. **Smart Contract Verification**: Verify contract addresses on BaseScan

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email**: security@gonftme.com (if available)
3. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, potential impact
4. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### Bug Bounty Program

We may offer rewards for critical security vulnerabilities:
- **Critical**: $500 - $2000
- **High**: $200 - $500
- **Medium**: $50 - $200
- **Low**: Recognition

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-7**: Initial response and validation
- **Day 7-30**: Fix development and testing
- **Day 30-60**: Deployment and verification
- **Day 60+**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)

## Security Audits

### Completed Audits
- Internal security review: âœ… Completed
- Automated security scanning: âœ… Ongoing
- Smart contract testing: âœ… 100% coverage

### Planned Audits
- External smart contract audit: ðŸ“‹ Planned for mainnet deployment
- Penetration testing: ðŸ“‹ Planned for production

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Implement emergency measures if needed
   - Document all actions taken

2. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide regular updates
   - Maintain transparency

3. **Resolution**
   - Deploy fixes
   - Verify resolution
   - Conduct post-incident review

## Security Tools and Configurations

### Static Analysis
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Detects security anti-patterns
- **SonarJS**: Code quality and security analysis
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and compile-time checks

### Dependency Management
- **npm audit**: Regular vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **License compliance**: Ensure secure and compatible licenses

### Runtime Security
- **Error Boundaries**: Prevent application crashes
- **Input Validation**: Runtime input sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse (planned for production)

## Compliance

### Standards Adherence
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Web3 Security Best Practices**: Following industry standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy by design (where applicable)

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly security reviews
- Quarterly dependency audits
- Annual penetration testing (planned)

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **General Security**: Create an issue with the `security` label
- **Vulnerability Reports**: Use responsible disclosure process
- **Emergency**: Contact repository maintainers directly
